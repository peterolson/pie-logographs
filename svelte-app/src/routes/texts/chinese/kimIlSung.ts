// 白頭山頂正日峰
// 小白水河碧溪流
// 光明星誕五十週
// 皆讚文武忠孝備
// 萬民稱頌齊同心
// 歡呼聲高震天地

// On the peak of Mt. Paekdu lies Jong-il Peak;
// In the Sobaeksu River, the blue creek flows.
// It is fifty years since the radiant star was born;
// All extol his civility and martiality, his possession of loyalty and filiality.
// The myriad people utter praise with united mind,
// And the cries of hurrah are so loud they shake heaven and earth.
