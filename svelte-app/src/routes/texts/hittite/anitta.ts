	translation: `Anitta, Son of Pithāna, King of Kussara, speak!  
    He was dear to the Stormgod of Heaven,  
	and when he was dear to the Stormgod of Heaven, the king of Nesa [verb broken off] to the king of Kussara. 
	The king of Kussara, Pithana, came down out of the city in force, 
	and he took the city of Nesa in the night by force.  
	He took the King of Nesa captive,
	but he did not do any evil to the inhabitants of Nesa;
	instead, he treated them as mothers and fathers.
	After my father, Pithana, I suppresed a revolt in the same year. 
	Whatever lands rose up in the direction of the sunrise, I defeated each of the aforementioned.`
