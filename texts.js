        The sheep said to the horses: "My heart pains me, seeing a man driving horses." 
        The horses said: "Listen, sheep, our hearts pain us when we see this: a man, the master, makes the wool of the sheep into a warm garment for himself. And the sheep has no wool." 
        Having heard this, the sheep fled into the plain`,
